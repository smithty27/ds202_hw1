# Homework #1
## *Tyler Smith; smithty27 on github* ##

The job I am trying to get is sports analytics. Data science plays a *major* factor in this since the analysts need to interpret the data to do a number of analyses and predictive modeling. One job in particular that is relevant in the sports analytics world is called research and development, a field that I **really** want to get into. Here is a link (<https://www.workinsports.com/usrjobdetail-bt?jobid=355852>) to a job that is in the field with a company called Fanatics. This job is something I would enjoy doing, especially with the combinatioion of different aspects that I am interested in.
